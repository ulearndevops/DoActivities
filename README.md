1. Ensure local administrator and password are set up before proceeding with the application and replication process.


2. Confirm that a backup of the source server is available before starting the migration.


3. Verify if we have a test server available for migration testing before proceeding with the actual server migration.


4. Peter, please check if there is any existing appliance. If not, we will need to set it up.


5. The on-prem server should be in a stopped state during migration. As discussed, the expected downtime is 24 hours, but it may be shorter depending on data size and bandwidth availability.



Let me know if there are any clarifications needed.

Best,
[Your Name]

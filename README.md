**Subject:** Update: AWS Support Response on IP Allocation for Migration Servers

Hello Team,

Please find the attached response from the AWS support team. They have confirmed that we cannot assign static IPs to the servers launched by the migration service. 

As an alternative, they suggest creating a new private CIDR range under the same VPC with a more limited number of IPs. 

Given that we have approximately 70 servers to migrate, and each source server will trigger the creation of 4 servers in AWS (replication, conversion, test, and cutover), some of which are temporary, we estimate needing at least 250 IPs in the new subnets. 

If you are planning to create a new private subnet in the AWS account, please consider these requirements.

Let me know if you need further details or have any questions.

Best regards,

This should clearly communicate the situation and provide the details they need to proceed.

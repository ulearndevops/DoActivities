Subject: Action Required: EKS Cluster Usage Confirmation and Upgrade Plan

Hello,

Below are the actions required for the EKS clusters running for app1:

1. eks-app1-poc (EKS 1.28) – This cluster is running in the AWS sandbox account. Please confirm if you are still using it. If it is in use, we need to upgrade it to the latest version, 1.32, upgrading step by step from 1.29 onward. If it is no longer needed, we will proceed with deletion.


2. dev-app1-ekscluster-poc (EKS 1.29) – This cluster is running in the AWS dev-lb account. Please confirm if you are still using it. If so, we will upgrade it to 1.32. Additionally, I noticed that node groups are present in this cluster. Since I believe you are using only Fargate, can we delete the node groups if they are not in use?


3. test-ip-ap-lob-ekscluster01 (EKS 1.30) – This cluster is running in the AWS test-lb account. Please confirm if you are still using it. If so, we will upgrade it step by step to 1.32.



Important Note:

Some of these clusters have been running since EKS 1.28. The upgrade process follows a sequential approach:

We will upgrade one version at a time (e.g., 1.28 → 1.29 → 1.30, and so on).

Each upgrade requires validation from your end before proceeding to the next version.


Please confirm the status of each cluster at the earliest so we can proceed accordingly.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

To ensure that updating the `~/.aws/credentials` file does not affect other profiles, you need to carefully update only the specified profile while leaving other profiles unchanged. Below is an enhanced version of the Jenkins pipeline to ensure only the specified profile is updated.

### First Job: Credential Refresh Job

#### Jenkinsfile (First Job):

```
The exception you're encountering (`com.cloudbees.groovy.cps.impl.BlockScopeEnv.locals`) is typically due to trying to use non-serializable objects within the CPS (Continuation Passing Style) transformation that Jenkins pipelines use. To avoid this, we need to ensure all Groovy objects and methods used in the pipeline script are compatible with Jenkins' CPS.

Hereâ€™s a revised version of the first script that addresses these concerns:

### First Job: Credential Refresh Job

#### Jenkinsfile (First Job):

Certainly! Here's a simplified version of the Jenkins pipeline script for the first job, focusing on using `sh` to assume the AWS role, update the credentials file, and print its contents:

### Simplified First Job: Credential Refresh Job

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        ROLE_ARN = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/YourRoleName"
        SESSION_NAME = "YourSessionName"
        AWS_PROFILE = "your-aws-profile"  // Replace with your AWS profile name
    }

    stages {
        stage('Assume Role and Update Credentials') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def assumeRoleAndRefreshCredentials = {
                        def command = "aws sts assume-role --role-arn ${ROLE_ARN} --role-session-name ${SESSION_NAME} --profile ${AWS_PROFILE}"
                        def result = sh(script: command, returnStdout: true).trim()
                        def jsonSlurper = new groovy.json.JsonSlurper()
                        def credentials = jsonSlurper.parseText(result).Credentials

                        def accessKeyId = credentials.AccessKeyId
                        def secretAccessKey = credentials.SecretAccessKey
                        def sessionToken = credentials.SessionToken

                        // Update AWS CLI config with new credentials for the specific profile
                        sh "aws configure set aws_access_key_id ${accessKeyId} --profile ${AWS_PROFILE}"
                        sh "aws configure set aws_secret_access_key ${secretAccessKey} --profile ${AWS_PROFILE}"
                        sh "aws configure set aws_session_token ${sessionToken} --profile ${AWS_PROFILE}"

                        echo "Successfully assumed role and updated credentials for profile ${AWS_PROFILE}"
                    }

                    assumeRoleAndRefreshCredentials()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

### Explanation:

- **Assume AWS Role:** Uses `aws sts assume-role` command to assume the specified AWS role and redirects the output to `~/.aws/temp_credentials`.
- **Update AWS Credentials File:** Uses `awk` within `sh` to update the `~/.aws/credentials` file:
  - Checks if the profile (`[PROFILE_NAME]`) already exists. If it does, updates it with new credentials; if not, appends a new profile with the credentials.
- **Print Updated Credentials:** Prints the contents of the updated `~/.aws/credentials` file to the Jenkins job console.
- **Clean Up:** Removes the temporary credentials file (`~/.aws/temp_credentials`) used to store the assumed role output.

This script utilizes shell commands (`sh`) to handle all operations, avoiding complex Groovy functions and ensuring compatibility with Jenkins CPS (Continuation Passing Style). Adjust paths and AWS CLI commands as per your environment and requirements.
### Explanation:

1. **Shell Command to Assume Role:** The `sh` step is used to assume the AWS role and save the credentials output to a file (`assume-role-output.json`). This avoids using non-serializable objects directly in the script.
2. **Read and Parse Credentials:** The output from the file is read and parsed using Groovy's `JsonSlurper`.
3. **Update AWS Credentials File:** The AWS credentials file is updated with the new profile, ensuring other profiles are not affected.
4. **Print AWS Credentials File:** The contents of the updated credentials file are printed to the console.

This approach ensures compatibility with Jenkins CPS and should avoid the `BlockScopeEnv.locals` exception.

### Second Job: Job Using Refreshed Credentials

#### Jenkinsfile (Second Job):

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        PROFILE_NAME = 'my-profile'
        FIRST_JOB_NAME = 'credential-refresh-job'
        FIRST_JOB_CRON = 'H/50 * * * *'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Schedule First Job') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Schedule the first job
                    scheduleFirstJob(env.FIRST_JOB_NAME, env.FIRST_JOB_CRON)
                    // Trigger the first job immediately
                    build job: env.FIRST_JOB_NAME, wait: true
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Use Refreshed AWS Credentials') {
            steps {
                withAWSProfile(env.PROFILE_NAME) {
                    sh '''
                        # Your long-running operations using the refreshed credentials
                        aws s3 ls
                    '''
                }
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            script {
                // Remove the schedule for the first job
                unscheduleFirstJob(env.FIRST_JOB_NAME)
            }
        }
    }
}

def scheduleFirstJob(jobName, cronSchedule) {
    def job = Jenkins.instance.getItemByFullName(jobName)
    if (job) {
        def trigger = new hudson.triggers.TimerTrigger(cronSchedule)
        job.addTrigger(trigger)
        trigger.start(job, true)
        job.save()
    }
}

def unscheduleFirstJob(jobName) {
    def job = Jenkins.instance.getItemByFullName(jobName)
    if (job) {
        job.triggers.clear()
        job.save()
    }
}

def withAWSProfile(profileName, closure) {
    withEnv(["AWS_PROFILE=${profileName}"]) {
        closure()
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **First Job:**
  - Assumes an AWS role and refreshes credentials.
  - Updates only the specified profile in `~/.aws/credentials` without affecting other profiles.
  - The `updateAWSCredentialsFile` function ensures that only the specified profile is updated or added if it doesn't exist.

- **Second Job:**
  - Schedules the first job to run every 50 minutes using a cron schedule.
  - Immediately triggers the first job to refresh credentials.
  - Uses the refreshed AWS credentials by setting the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable.
  - Performs its tasks using the refreshed credentials.
  - Stops the first job's schedule after completing its tasks.

### Key Points:

- **Cron Schedule:** The `FIRST_JOB_CRON` environment variable sets the cron expression to run the first job every 50 minutes. Adjust the cron expression as needed.
- **Scheduling and Unscheduling:** The `scheduleFirstJob` and `unscheduleFirstJob` functions manage the cron schedule for the first job.
- **Profile Update:** The `updateAWSCredentialsFile` function ensures only the specified profile in the AWS credentials file is updated with new credentials, leaving other profiles unaffected.

This setup ensures that the second job schedules and uses the first job for credential refresh, performs its tasks, and then cleans up by stopping the first job's schedule, all while ensuring that only the specified profile in the credentials file is updated.
